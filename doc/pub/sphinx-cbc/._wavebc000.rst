*Summary.* The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how
different types of boundary conditions impacts the solution of
standard, linear wave equation in one spatial dimension. Four types of
conditions are treated: known value (Dirichlet condition), zero flux
(Neumann condition), open boundary, and periodic boundary.
