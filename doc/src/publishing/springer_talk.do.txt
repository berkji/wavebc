===== Modern publishing has many venues =====

!bblock Classical publishing venues:
books, journals, conference proceedings, local compendia
!eblock

!bpop
!bblock Modern publishing venues:
 * books, journals, proceedings (need publisher)
 * blog posts
 * project websites at "GitHub": "http://github.com", "Bitbucket": "https://bitbucket.org/", "Figshare": "http://figshare.com/", "Zenodo": "http://zenodo.org/" (w/DOI), ...
 * (document sharing sites at "latex-lab": "http://docs.latexlab.org/docs", "Google docs": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docsl", "Draft": "https://draftin.com/", "stackedit.io": "https://stackedit.io/", ...)
 * (Dropbox, Google Drive)
 * promotion through Twitter, Google+, Facebook, ...

# How can publishers get more influence in the new venues?

!split
===== New venues also offer new publishing formats =====

 o _PDF_ (via LaTeX)
 o _HTML_ (via plain text, Sphinx, Markdown, Doconce, ... - not LaTeX)
 o Special e-book formats: _epub_, _mobi_, ... (PDF via "Calibre": "http://calibre-ebook.com/")
 o Interactive _notebooks_ (via IPython notebook, Sage, Mathematica, ...)
 o iBooks (via Apple's app)


!bwarning Our special requirement:
*Strong support for mathematics and computer code!*

===== PDF is for paper, HTML for screen =====

!bslidecell 00 0.6

!bblock My assertion:
PDF works on screens, but HTML is more appealing
and has much more functionality.

===== My conclusion: use generalized formats to write scientific material =====

!bpop
 * LaTeX has been the de facto standard format
 * Conversion tools from LaTeX to HTML do not work well
 * Solution: write in a more *primitive format* that easily *converts* to LaTeX, HTML, and whatever
   * "Doconce": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/web/index.html", "Markdown": "http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/", "Sphinx": "http://sphinx-doc.org/", "IPython notebooks": "http://ipython.org/notebook.html", (Google Docs)

!bwarning
LaTeX (paper) and HTML (screen) apply different typography. Writing in a
simpler common format is different from classical LaTeX writing.

# Example: Floating elements: only figures can be floating,
# algorithms, tables, etc. must be inlineed at fixed locations
# in the running text.

!split
===== My scientific writings are converted to several formats =====

!bnotice Note
HTML versions often have additional functionality (movies, embedded services,
multiple-choice tests).

===== Wishlist (part 1) =====

 * Alternative formats of a book can be published
   (at Springer, GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, ...)
 * Springer stamps on all derived material with a link to the official book
 * During production: share files with authors professionally
   (GitHub/Bitbucket)

!split
===== Trend: from linear monograph to graph of smaller, more independent units =====

!bslidecell 00 0.6
 * Kahn Academy success: many small teaching units (videos)
 * Units are connected in a graph
 * Learning is about following paths in the graph
 * Tools can find personalized paths
 * Units are videos, notebooks, online material,
   book chapters, papers, ...
 * This idea is accelerated by MOOCs

!split
===== More independent teaching units support more reuse =====

Add to wishlist:
 * Publish (modified) parts of a unit (from a book) online
 * Always stamp derived material with link to the parent publication!

!split
===== Next generation video: "studix.com": "http://studix.com" =====

 * Classical video: series of frames of pixels
 * studix.com video is a tree of objects rendered as a film in the browser
 * Objects can be handwriting, graphs, videos, notebooks, slides, sound, links to other videos, books, ...
 * Very enhanced video editing!
 * Browser movies are tightly integrated with books and organized as a graph

!split
===== Fact today: publishers have no control of pre-use or reuse of copyright material =====

# Googling brings you to the material below, NOT to the book!

 * Book chapters are easily found on the net as
   * LaTeX PDF
   * blog posts
   * open notebooks
   * source files (on GitHub, Bitbucket, ...)
 * Seldom mentioning of the (final) book in these resources
 * Papers are found as preprints in arXiv.org, ResearchGate, Mendeley, Figshare, Zenodo, ...

!split
===== Trend: visibility is key =====

!bblock
Authors are researchers who need visibility, a big network, citations, and
a significant volume of material.
!eblock

Young researchers

 * use top journals and publishers to bring credibility
 * use project sites (GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, ...) to display research
 * use arXiv.org, ResearchGate, Mendeley to exhibit papers
 * use Twitter, Google+, Facebook to announce new material
 * use amazon.com ("CreateSpace": "https://www.createspace.com/") independent publishing

!bnotes
The publishing industry must

  * realize what is happening with copyright material
  * realize what the future demands are
  * approve reuse of copyright material, with a watermark
  * realize that visibility is the important thing for authors
!enotes

!split
===== Summary and wishlist =====

!bblock Assertions
 * Books must be available in more formats (PDF, HTML, epub, notebooks)
 * The linear monograph will be a graph of more independent units
!eblock

!bblock Wishlist
 * Alternative formats of a book can be published
   (at Springer, GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, ...)
 * Publish (modified) parts of a unit (from a book) online
