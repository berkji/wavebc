======= Modern publishing has a jungle of venues =======

!bblock Classical publishing venues
books, journals, conference proceedings, local compendia

!bblock Modern publishing venues
 * books, journals, proceedings
 * blog posts
 * project websites at, e.g., "GitHub": "http://github.com", "Bitbucket": "https://bitbucket.org/", "Figshare": "http://figshare.com/", "Zenodo": "http://zenodo.org/" (w/DOI)
 * document sharing sites at, e.g., Google docs, "Draft": "https://draftin.com/", "stackedit.io": "https://stackedit.io/" (limited math/code support)
 * (Dropbox, Google Drive)
 * promotion through Google+, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, ...

Publishers have full control of classical venues and no control
of the new venues. *How to increase the influence*?

======= Modern publishing formats are of four types =======

!bpop
!bblock Formats:
 o PDF
 o HTML
 o Special e-book formats: epub, mobi, ...
 o Interactive notebooks
!eblock

!bblock How to generate:
 o PDF: LaTeX
 o HTML: many tools (Sphinx, Markdown, ... - not LaTeX)
 o e-book formats: from PDF via "Calibre": "http://calibre-ebook.com/"
 o Interactive notebooks: IPython notebook, Mathematica, ...
!eblock

!bwarning Our special requirement:
The format and the generating tool must have strong support for
mathematics and computer code.

======= PDF is for paper, HTML for the screen =======

!bblock
My assertion: PDF works on screens, but HTML is more appealing
and has much more functionality.

======= I use a generalized format to write my books (and everything else) =======

 * LaTeX is the dec facto standard format for math and code
 * Conversion tools from LaTeX to HTML do not work well
 * Write in a simpler format that easily converts to whatever
   * "Doconce": "http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/web/index.html"
   * "Markdown": "http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"
   * "Sphinx": "http://sphinx-doc.org/"
   * "IPython notebooks": "http://ipython.org/notebook.html"
   * Google Docs

!split
======= My scientific writings are converted to several formats =======

 * "Doconce source code": "_static/wavebc.do.txt.html"
 * "PDF for printing": "_static/wavebc_4print.pdf"
 * "PDF for screen": "_static/wavebc.pdf"
 * "HTML Sphinx CBC": "_static/sphinx-cbc/._wavebc001.html"
 * "HTML Sphinx FEniCS": "_static/sphinx-fenics_minimal/._wavebc001.html"
 * "HTML solarized": "_static/._wavebc_solarized002.html#sec:math:pde"
 * "HTML Bootstrap 1": "_static/wavebc_journal.html"
 * "HTML Bootstrap 2": "_static/wavebc_cyborg.html"
 * IPython notebook
 * BLOG POST Google!!!!

In addition, I produce slides (brief *study guides*) in the same formats.

!bnotice Note
HTML versions often have additional functionality (movies, embedded services,
quiz/survey).

======= Wishlist =======

 * Springer prints books and make e-books as usual
 * color{red}{Springer or I publishes alternative formats}
 * We publish HTML-based formats at professional project sites (GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, ...)
 * color{red}{Springer should demand a ``watermark'' on all derived versions of material appearing in a book}
